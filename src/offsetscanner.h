/**
 * @brief The HeroPointerLocator class finds the RVA of the hero array pointer
 * inside hota.dll while the game is running.
 *
 * Every HotA release rebuilds hota.dll, which shifts that RVA and used to
 * require rebuilding H3roViewer with a new hardcoded
 * HOTA_DLL_TO_HERO_SECTION_POINTER_OFFSET. This class runs the same signature
 * scan that scripts/find_hota_offsets.py does, except it reads the module that
 * is already mapped into the game process and then *confirms* the candidate by
 * following it and checking that the memory behind it really looks like the
 * hero array. The hardcoded constant is only used as a fallback.
 *
 * The confirmed value is cached in QSettings, keyed by the PE timestamp and
 * image size of hota.dll, so swapping in a different build (HD Mod ships its
 * own) invalidates the cache on its own.
